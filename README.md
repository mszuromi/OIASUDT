Code and Data associated with the paper: "Optimization of Ictal Aborting Stimulation Using the Dynamotype Taxonomy."

DESCRIPTION:

The data and scripts are meant to show how burster dynamics determine response to a single biphasic stimulus. The files include data which show trends in the propensity of termination for different burster types and the MATLAB scripts used to generate this data. The MATLAB scripts also allow the user to generate their own data sets for alternative bursting paths and stimulus parameter combinations. Furthermore, they allow the user to visually examine the effects of single stimuli in the voltage timeseries and in state space. How the user can access these features of the script is described in the file "ReadMe.pdf" which is located in the .zip folder.

METHODOLOGY:

Data was generated by a MATLAB script to analyze the propensity of termination for different bursters (simulated seizures) generated by a minimal model of seizure dynamics. Several thousand stimuli are applied over the duration of several burster classes, and the responses of each burster to the stimulus were analyzed. Each data point consists of information describing the burster, parameters of the applied stimulus, and the quantitative effect of the stimulus on burster duration. In the file "ReadMe.pdf," the data generation process is discussed in more detail.
